    "The article talks about technical debt, specifically in machine learning. They argue that ML system has a special capacity to incur technical debt. It mentions different aspects of this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the section (2 Complex Models Erode Boundaries) we particilarly thought that the examples of Correction Cascaces and Undeclared customers were interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the section (3 Data Dependencies Cost More than Code Dependecies) it mentions how some unstable or underitilized data dependenencies can be detremental in the long term. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the section (4 Feedback Loops) it talks about how some aspects of a system may influence the functionality of others without the direct knowledge of the developers. We particularly thought that the example of how different recommendation systems on a website could influence eachother was interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section (5 ML-System Anti-Patterns) talks about the importance of abstraction and structure when writing ML code. How package structure and code visibility can be important, and gives examples of certain pitfalls that can happen when implemnented correctly or when the code is worked on by different people with different underlying knowledge of the previous implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In section (6 Configuration Debt) the article gives examples of how the imporance of proper configuration of ML projects/implementations. It should be easy for a new user to make changes to the configuration and recognize the differences in configurations, while reducing the amounts of possible errors that can be made, while also easing the regonition of these potential errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Section (7 Dealing with changes in the external world) mentions several ideas on how to keep a system ready for change in the external world, and how to test the system so that the developers are able to properly adapt the system to the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "(8 Other Areas of ML-related Debt) highlights some other important things like Rerproducability-, Procces Management, and Cultural Debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last conclusion chapter they discuss how to look at technical debt in ML systems and they mention that they hope the paper can help aid in engineers having the ability to create more maintainable and sustainable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our takaways were mainly the importance of considering many aspects on how the ML code/system is integreated with the data and the world around it. To always keep in mind that for code to be usable by future engineers, or the developers themselves in the future, it is important that things are clear, structured, and that the system dependencies are well thought out. Sometimes things can influence eachother without our knowledge, and that can be a detrement to the system."
